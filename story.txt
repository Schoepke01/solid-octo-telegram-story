John was a young man who grew up in medieval England. His family was very
poor growing up and they were barely able to eat sufficient meals every night.
He always dreamed of becoming a famous knight and frequently sat, staring at
the large castle in the distance, hoping that his dream would one day become
true.
On a particularly warm night John sat outside his house to bask in the cool night breeze, intermittant as it was.  As he gazed at the moon, moments from drifting off to sleep he was awoken by a sudden bright flash and a tingling sensation in his right arm. 
"Huh, that was weird," though John before yawning once more. "Boy, I sure am tired. I will pretend like that sensational flashing glow is not pertinent to my story whatsoever."  
Days passed, the tingling sensation in his right arm went away. John on about his duties as usual, with no changes to his life. John continue to dream about becoming a famous knight and staring at the large castle. He thought to himself, enough is enough. I will no longer continue to dream about being a knight. I will go there myself and prove to them I am the strongest knight they have ever seen. John took his shovel and started his journey to the castle to prove himself to the King.
When he reached the castle, the king was helding a weightlifting competition. The best score is 500kg. At first he was a little worried for the heaviest rock he had lift is about 400kg. In order to achieve his dream he attempted to have a try. He walked to the 600kg rock and had a deep breath.

Suddenly, he had a tingling sensation in his right arm again. It was like it
had a conscience of its own. He bent down to pick up the rock, and he was
miraculously able to lift it up with ease. The king was astounded and immediately
knighted him and gave him a very high rank. From then on John lived happily
ever after.
